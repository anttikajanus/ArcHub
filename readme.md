#ArcHub - simple RSS reader for ArcGIS blogs

##Keywords
Esri, ArcGIS, Windows Phone, RSS reader

##Description
Application is a simple RSS Reader to Esri's ArcGIS Blog (http://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis).

This applcation was build on 2012 summer in one day so it's a bit plain. I had quite a hurry to get an application submitted to Nokia's developer campaing and this is what I managed to pull together. You can find application from [marketplace](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/archub/c64430d6-a5a3-40a6-a562-eb8def35da1e "Marketplace")

 Application uses Caliburn.Micro framework, read more about that at http://caliburnmicro.codeplex.com/.

## TODO 
* Background worker to update blogs
* Integration to live tiles
* Restyle whole app...
* Add more blogs...
